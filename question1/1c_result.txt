Part B : Using Standard Formulation with LinearSVC 
-------------------------------------------------

We will consider 5 cases in which, for each case we will take 2 folders as a testing folder 
and other folders as training folders.The accuracy for each of the cases are given below:

Case 1 , 2: Testing folder is 1 and 2 :
-------------------------------------------------
Standard SVM accuracy : 0.833910034602

Case 1 , 3: Testing folder is 1 and 3 :
-------------------------------------------------
Standard SVM accuracy : 0.833910034602

Case 1 , 4: Testing folder is 1 and 4 :
-------------------------------------------------
