Part A : Using Hinge Loss 
-------------------------------------------------

We will consider 5 cases in which, for each case we will take 2 folders as a testing folder 
and other folders as training folders.The accuracy for each of the 5 cases are given below:

Case 1: Testing folder is 1 and 2:
-------------------------------------------------
Linear SVM with hinge loss accuracy : 0.993079584775

Case 3: Testing folder is 3 and 4:
-------------------------------------------------
Linear SVM with hinge loss accuracy : 0.994809688581

Case 5: Testing folder is 5 and 6:
-------------------------------------------------
Linear SVM with hinge loss accuracy : 0.998272884283

Case 7: Testing folder is 7 and 8:
-------------------------------------------------
Linear SVM with hinge loss accuracy : 0.994809688581

Case 9: Testing folder is 9 and 10:
-------------------------------------------------
Linear SVM with hinge loss accuracy : 0.989655172414
